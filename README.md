# API Fellowship Project

This repository will be used for my work during the API Fellowship Program 2025.

As part of the fellowship, Iâ€™ll be contributing to open-source API-related projects, improving my backend development skills, and learning how large-scale systems are designed and maintained. I'm excited to explore different technologies, solve real-world problems, and collaborate with mentors and peers.

## Goals
- Learn and implement best practices in API development
- Contribute to open-source projects under mentorship
- Get hands-on experience with real-world software development
- Explore new technologies like Go and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

## Status
ðŸ“Œ Repository setup completed. Work will begin soon.
